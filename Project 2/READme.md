## How to Run the Simulation

- Change **line 2** of the `.asm` file to the desired value of `n` to run `Fibonacci(n)`.

## Where is the Result?

- Go to the **Data Segment** tab
- Look for memory address `0x10010000`
  - **Value(+0)** = `n`
  - **Value(+4)** = `Fibonacci(n)`
  - **Value(+8)** = `isFibOdd(n)` 1-Odd 0-Even

## Team Member Responsibilities

- **Devarsh Gandhi (34%)**  
  Collaboratively wrote the code for `Fibonacci(n)`. Combined `isOdd(m)` logic written by the group and added it to `Fibonacci(n)` code. Created `Readme.md`

- **Jalen Davis (33%)**  
  Collaborated with Drei and Devarsh on the starting code and provided input on the Fibonacci implementation. [edit here]

- **Andrei Aquino (33%)**  
  Collaboratively wrote the code for `Fibonacci(n)`. [add here]
